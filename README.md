A Humble Beginning

"A dragon's fire is not just breath
Forged in hate to hasten death.
It burns away the lies and sin
And leaves behind the truth within."

Today, my journey begins. The spark of adventure burns within me, and I will kindle it to a roaring inferno.
This is my path. My purpose. I will not lose sight of it. I will burn fast and bright.
All will see and know that I am the Dragon, and my flame is eternal.
